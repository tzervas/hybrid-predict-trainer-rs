## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**SECURITY VERDICT: ✅ PASS - NO VULNERABILITIES DETECTED**

Complete security audit performed on hybrid-predict-trainer-rs. All critical security requirements met:
- **Unsafe code:** None (enforced via `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`)
- **Panic paths:** None in library code
- **Information leakage:** None detected in error handling
- **Error recovery:** Proper implementation with typed errors

Code quality issues identified are **non-critical** and mostly ergonomic improvements.
